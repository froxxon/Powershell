# Powershell
A repository containing my powershellscripts for different system, from Collection-creation in SCCM, analyzing of a Windows Firewall log file, opening C$ on a Windows 10 client rmeotely to reading RADIUS logs etc.

The two largest *"serious"* script/modules for my part is so far the ones for AD-delegation as well as 2Pint Softwares Stifler-PS module.
